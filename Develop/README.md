# Horiseon Challenge 

## Description

-For my first challenge was an On-The-Job ticket. This required me to modify & refactor some existing code.
A marketing agency has hired me to make thier site more accessible to the public and others with disabilities.

-When inpecting the code a few links of the site were not funtioning properly. The HTML required adding & changing the semantic elements as most were all classed as '<div>'. 

-The title was changed to something more suitable and clear. The CSS selectors were conolidated methodically and reaaranged to keep the flow logical with CSS & HTML structure.

-Additionally, comments were added to the CSS explaining some of the selectors purpose and functions.

-While working on this site, I learnt that though there may be a solution to an issue it may not be the best for the current problem. Searching for multipule solutions to a problem helps to ensure you find the appropriate one.
